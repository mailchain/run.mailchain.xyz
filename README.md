# run.mailchain.xyz LEGACY - [DEPRECATED]

In the early days of Mailchain’s development we used the code in this legacy branch to send messages on chain. It’s kept for reference and educational purposes only. This branch is **NOT being worked on, will NOT have security fixes applied, and should NOT be used.** You can find the latest developments on the [main branch](https://github.com/mailchain/mailchain).
